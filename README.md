# Deepfake Detection 🔍🖼️

**Deepfake Detection** is a powerful project designed to detect AI-generated deepfake content using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques. As deepfakes become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent, this project aims to provide an effective solution for identifying manipulated images and videos to combat misinformation and maintain digital integrity.

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on the detection of deepfake videos and images by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other cutting-edge ML techniques. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to accurately differentiate between real and fake content, achieving high precision and recall rates. The application is useful for media outlets, security agencies, and digital content creators to verify the authenticity of multimedia content.

## ✨ Features

- **High Accuracy Detection**: Uses advanced CNN models to detect deepfakes with high accuracy.
- **Scalable Model**: Can be scaled to analyze large datasets and real-time video streams.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple web interface to upload and analyze media files.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Capable of detecting deepfakes in real-time video feeds.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional for storing results)
- **Deployment**: Heroku / AWS
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
